# Restrict access to the Mesos WebUI to ocfroot users only.
# We do this because it allows some very destructive actions.
#
# Note that this PAM service is used only for authentication to the nginx
# proxy. Mesos does not support PAM authentication (it currently only supports
# hardcoded passwords in a config file).
#
# We do not expect staff to talk to Mesos directly, but instead only through
# the nginx proxy.
